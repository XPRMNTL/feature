# Stuff I want to do

## Application
1. Dashboard for setting configurations
2. Github Authentication
3. Adding Apps (github write privileges)
4. Percentages
5. Boolean flags
6. Boolean for specific apps
7. Send / receive configurations
8. Testing
9. Testing
10. Tie in business metrics
11. Add Variants (multiple sliders / colored slider?)
12. Environments
13. Remove experiments when the app doesn't say it has it
14. Deps versions with announcement
15. Ping Status
16. Backup data -> Submits a pull request against the experiments_config.json

## Consumer
1. Send / receive configurations
2. Testing
3. Testing
4. Ping-back awareness on startup?



## Ideas
* When scaling up an experiment, show diff change before "apply".


## Things to remember to test
* Make sure there's no duplicate app ids?
